# python-challenge

had trouble figuring out how to change the file path as requested in the rubric
initially started the assignement just trying to get the code to work properly and didn't focus on making it path to a seperate folder to retrieve data
i understand the concept of pathing but need to refresh on actual implementation

also not sure what is happening with the f'string printing at the end 

when initially formatting i could get two seperate lines to write to a text file even with {variables} being used
not sure why it stopped working after multiple \n
